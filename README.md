# Info

MultiCMET, a multimodal Chinese metaphor dataset, consisting of 13,820 text-image pairs of advertisements with manual annotations of the occurrence of metaphors, source and target domain categories, and sentiments metaphors convey. 

The collection of the Chinese dataset consists of two parts. 

1. The first part, named 'ZH_pbs.csv', involves collecting potential Chinese advertising metaphor samples by searching relevant keywords related to "advertisements" and "metaphors" on Baidu and Bing. The second column contains image links, which can be used to access the images. 
2. The second part, named 'ZH_ifs.csv', involves collecting potential Chinese metaphorical advertising samples from a large-scale Chinese commercial advertising dataset publicly released by the 2021 iFlytek Advertising Image Classification Competition. The first column represents the image ID, which corresponds to the IDs in the 2021 advertising dataset and can be used to retrieve the images.
